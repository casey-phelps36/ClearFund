# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Phone Policy

No distracted use of technology (e.g. phones away) during all team meetings.

## Decisions

The team will aim for consensus in all major decisions. If consensus cannot be reached, a majority vote will determine the outcome. Once a decision is made, all team members agree to fully support and implement it.

## Attendance

All team members are expected to attend all scheduled class sessions where group work occurs. If a team member is sick, has an emergency, or has another legitimate reason to not be in class, they should notify their team members as soon as possible. If someone is not in class, they are still responsible for their part of the project that should have been worked on that day.

## Assignments

Assignments will be distributed fairly among members based on workload, strengths, and interests as discussed by the group. All tasks must be checked and submitted by the assigned due date. Team members are encouraged to review each other's work and provide additional feedback before the final submission.

To monitor progress throughout the project, members should provide updates after each major or notable change. If a member does not complete or completes an assignment poorly, the group will first address the issue internally through private communication. 

## Participation

Communication will take place through group chats for regular updates and in-person meetings for deeper discussion and planning. To ensure full participation, all members are expected to contribute to discussions and respond to messages promptly.
If a member wishes to take on a specific job or task, they may announce and discuss it with the group. The team will strive to honor individual strengths and interests when assigning work to foster engagement and high-quality contributions.

## Meeting Times

Meeting times and locations will be decided collaboratively based on all members' availability. The default meeting location will be on campus, with the specific time and place agreed upon through group discussion or a poll. Alternative arrangements, such as online meetings, may be made if necessary to accommodate all members. 

## Agenda

SCRUM will open each meeting by reviewing the previous meeting’s minutes and confirming action items. The SCRUM lead will then assign or confirm tasks for each team member. After that, each person will provide a brief status update on completed work, current progress, and any blockers, and explain their plan for completing their assigned tasks before the next meeting. Meeting minutes will be recorded by the designated note-taker and shared with the team after the meeting

## Promptness

Team members are expected to join meetings on time and be ready to give their update. A 5-minute grace period will be allowed for unexpected delays. If someone will be late or absent, they must notify the group in advance (via our team chat). Repeated lateness will be addressed by the SCRUM lead through a quick follow-up conversation and may result in task adjustments to keep the sprint on track.

## Conversational Courtesies

Our team will prioritize having respectful, balanced and productive communication during all meetings and collaborations. Individuals will practice active listening by avoiding interruptions and asking clarifying questions and summarizing key points. To ensure equal airtime, team members will be mindful of how much we speak and invite others to speak. If conversation goes off topic, any team members can suggest putting the idea on hold for later discussion. We will critique ideas rather than individuals and assume positive intent.


## Enforcement Guidelines

To enforce norms, we will reflect at the end of meetings to ensure that everyone has space to contribute and that our standards are upheld. If issues arise, then the team will address them as respectfully and directly as possible. Feedback will be specific and focused on behaviors and outcomes rather than personal traits. If conflicts cannot be resolved internally, the team will involve the professor if necessary

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
